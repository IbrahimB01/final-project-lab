# Blockchain Project - Simple Implementation

## Overview
This project demonstrates the basic implementation of a blockchain using Python. It includes:
- Block creation and linking
- SHA-256 hashing mechanism for security
- Proof of Work consensus mechanism
- Blockchain validation

## Files
- `simple_blockchain.py`: Contains the code for creating blocks and linking them.
- `validate_chain.py`: Validates the blockchain to check its integrity.
- `proof_of_work.py`: Implements the Proof of Work mechanism.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python scripts using:
   ```bash
   python simple_blockchain.py
   python validate_chain.py
   python proof_of_work.py
